# Tech Talent Factory - DevOps Class 2020

This is the "archetype repository" for the students of Tech Talent Factory - DevOps Class 2020.

Into this repository will be saved the exercises done by the students during the class. The final assessment partially depends by the content and the usage of this repository.

## Usage

Students will have to fork this repository on our GitHub account, insert their data into the STUDENTS.md file and finally make a pull request of the updated STUDENTS.md file.

After that, the students will use this repository, their own fork, as a single repository for all their exercises. The teacher considers the students repository as **the only source of truth**, therefore no other file, exercise or implementation will be taken into consideration for the final assessment.
